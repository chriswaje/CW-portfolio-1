# cw-portfolio-1

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create and design the first iteration of a working portfolio to be used in future career applications. By using a combination of HTML and CSS, this portfolio displays an understanding of how to use HTML to fill content and CSS to style content and use media queries in order to create a reactive design that reformats depending on the user's screen size. The motivation for this project was to practice creating professional career tools by practicing design and user interaction. This project solves the issue of learning how CSS can be utilized in order to personalize applications to fit the developers' design and creating applications that are usable on different consoles or different browser sizes.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the webpage properly, use the navigation bar in the header to navigate through the different sections of the portfolio. By hovering over the displayed works in the 'Work' section, users will see a glowing effect on the project that can be selected. By clicking on the selected project, users will be redirected to the project itself. The contact me displays a phone number, and interactive email/resume buttons if users' wish to contact the developer.

## Credits

TA Megan Meyers helped with providing insight on how to reafactor the CSS coding to create a more sleek and easily formatted application. Megan also further explained how media queries should be used in order to create more reactive designs that change format for browsers that are of differing sizes. CodingLab's youtube page provided videos on how to use CSS to create a glowing effect on the hover property in CSS. The mailto property used in the email button was learned from W3docs.com to automatic redirect users to email the developer.
